<h2>Bowhead Technology: Digital Markeing Intern</h2>

<p>
This past summer, I intered at Bowhead Technology as a Digital Marketing Intern for their latest product, The Gululu Interactive Water Bottle. This water bottle aims at helping children stay healthy and drink enough water by gamifing the water drinking experience. Working with digital marketing, I worked on creating and curating content for blog posts for websites and emails as well as their social media sites. I identified which days were the best days to post on sites by looking at data on the number of likes and clicks on previous posts while keeping the social media calendar oraganzied and up to date.

<h2>Jericho Taxi Brokers: Assistant Lease Manager</h2>
<p>
In summer 2018, I intered at Jericho Taxi Brokers as an Assistant Lease Manager. I used software called open data in which I generated reports based on specific dates and times the taxi's were being driven by our drivers. I looked at data on which cabs were in highest usage on certain holidays, for example, and learned to draw valuable conclusions based on these results. Specifically, I got to look at New Years Eve data across different years. Data showed that in certain years, it is best to have drivers stay in New York City because it is a very busy night, which means lots of business, but other years, the cars lose more by staying in the city because of repairs that go into vandalism.

<h2>Peace Neighborhood Center: Peer Tutor</h2>
<p>
Throughout the year, I tutor elementary school students in the Ann Arbor Community at the Peace Neighborhood Center. I help students struggling both at home and in school by helping them with their math and their reading after their school day. This opportunity has given me organizational skills as well as leadership skills and patience.
