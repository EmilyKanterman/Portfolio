<h2>Web Design, Development, and Accessibility:</h2> 
<p>This course provides a hands-on approach to learning responsive, accessible front- end programming for Web Design. I am learning HTML5, CSS3, Bootstap, and JavaScript. A project I am currently working with group members to help a client redo their portfolio to make it accessible and aesthetic. 
</p>

<h2>Data Manipulation:</h2> 
<p>This class gives me the skills to learn Python and its modules to gather, parse, and summaraize large data sets to help understand users' information needs. Using Pandas, numpy, and SQL, I am learning how to clean data and draw valuable conclusions in an organized, understandable way.
</p>

<h2>Information Enviornments and Work:</h2>
<p>This course looks at information's role in organizations, including psychological, economic, management and sociocultural perspectives. Explores sense-making and effective communication, including the importance of "story- telling." I am learning to work through case studies, identifying key stakeholders and their interests, information infrastrucutres, and requirements for solutions.
</p>


<h2>Models of Social Information Processing:</h2>
<p>This course focuses on how social groups form, interact, and change. I look at the technical structures of social networks and explore how individual actions are combined to produce collective effects, by studying game theory and graph theory. 
</p>


<h2>Data-Oriented Programming:</h2>
<p>Develop core programming and software development skills, to build competency and literacy in data structures, debugging, and testing using github, pattern matching (regex) and programmatic gathering and processing of data.
